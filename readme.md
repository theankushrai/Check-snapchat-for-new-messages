### Check Snapchat for new messages

*This project which i want to use personally is to check snapchat and infuture whatsapp for new messages. as i am having issues with screen time on my devices. so i was thinking instead of keeping whatsapp/snapchat on and recieving all the messages all the time. create a python script that uses webscraping and selenium to tell me if i have recieved any message and from who*

## Flow 

1. run the script
2. if recieved message get message instantly and then in hour intervals. 
3. if not dont do anything.
4. script keeps running for 8 hours. 

## How to run the project

1. download all dependencies using setup.sh
2. download snapchat html file (for now i will automate it later)
2. run main.py
